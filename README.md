# Modfan

## What is Modfan?

**Modfan** is the ultimate new wiki farm that _(tries to)_ perfectly recreate [Fandom](https://www.fandom.com), a
wiki software using the Cosmos skin with [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org). If you are looking for a raw
MediaWiki recreation, then visit [GlitchWiki](https://glitchwiki-html.glitch.me).

Modfan was created on April 30, 2021 by [5qc](https://github.com/5qc).

## Where do I get Modfan?

As of May 5, 2021, you can't get it. This project is meant for my personal use and enjoyment, however I decided to throw it on GitHub so people can judge my sloppy stuff. Since this is the template page, you can view it on GitHub. However, if you were looking for the document section, enjoy [this](https://github.com/5qc/modfan-docs).
