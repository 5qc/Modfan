## What is Modfan?

**Modfan** is the ultimate new wiki farm that _(tries to)_ perfectly recreate [Fandom](https://www.fandom.com), a
wiki software using the Cosmos skin with [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org). If you are looking for a raw
MediaWiki recreation, then visit [GlitchWiki](https://glitchwiki-html.glitch.me).

Modfan was created on April 30, 2021 by [roc0ast3r](https://github.com/roc0ast3r).
